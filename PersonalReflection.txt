My contributions to the project included the alert
functionalities, which comprised of the alert class
and the alerthandler classes. In addition, I first
tested and implemented the serialization format that
we ultimately used to save user information.

I am proud of the method in which I implemented the
observer design pattern to keep track of when users
changed their respective calendar's. This allowed for
very fine control over how user sessions were maintained.

One thing I didn't expect going in to the project was
the pace at which the production code changes and
evolves. I thought that code should be perfected before
it was pushed out, but that really is an over-evaluation.
I realized that being fast and simple in designing
code is much more practical in a real life environment.
