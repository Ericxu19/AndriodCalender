The group communicated ideas well. During the few times
in which we all met together to discuss the implementation
of the calendar, we all had to reconcile our own separate
ideas of what to do into one cohesive plan. We were
adaptive and listened to each other's input.

If we were to work together again, one thing we could do
better is keep track of who was doing what a little better.
Often times, two people ended up doing the same thing at
the same time. If we could keep track of what was done
and not done more clearly, we could have avoided this issue.
